## Libraries Used

- Flutter Bloc
- dio
- Url launcher
- Sqflite
- Screen utils
- flutter_svg
- flutter_native_splash

## Flutter Bloc

used Cubit to manage the state of the app, ensuring that the UI reacts to changes in data and state without tightly coupling the logic with the UI

## dio

used dio in my project for its advanced features, including response interceptors for logging and error handling

## Url launcher

used for launching URLs

## Sqflite

used sqflite to store data persistently on the user's device

## flutter_svg

used flutter_svg to show SVG images and icons clearly on all screen sizes

## cached_network_image

used cached_network_image to load and cache images from the internet, improving performance and reducing repeated network calls

## flutter_native_splash

used flutter_native_splash to add a custom splash screen when the app starts

## Screen utils

used to make the app responsive on all devices. It adjusts the layout to fit different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring a consistent user experience across smartphones, tablets, and other devices

## Extra

 I used Aspect Ratio and Card ID, which were defined in the API but not initially part of the app's predefined schema

- I used Aspect Ratio value to ensure that images were displayed correctly across different screen sizes, preserving their proportions and fitting perfectly within their containers
- The Card ID, also defined in the API, allowed me to uniquely identify each card
